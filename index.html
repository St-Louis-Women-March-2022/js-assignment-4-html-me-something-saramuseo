            <h1>Now We Are Six</h1>
            <p>My beautiful Rosemarie was born in April 2017. 
               Three days of labor and she came out on her own time. 
               She just turned five and I started thinking about her sixth birthday and this poem.
               My aunt gave me A.A. Milne's book when I turned six, and my partner and I will do the same for Rosemarie.
               She continues to grow and develop her own personality, as we all do beyond the age of six. 
               I love her empathy, her curiosity, her bravery, her independence. 
               She is my love bug, and I dedicate his page to her.
               To my Rosemarie - Love your Mommy.
